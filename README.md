# ImageReelManager

This is a program used to display images in sequence. 

It was made initially for being used in drawing sessions, as it allows you display a series of images with a specific timer to each one of them, letting you to change the order the images are displayed as well. 

There is an attached a .exe file that allows you to run the program without installing, but it needs the C++ redistributable to run. If you don't want to install it or you don't have it you can use the .msi installer attached to install the program and run it normally.

You can find the files [here](https://github.com/seal63/ImageReelManager/releases)
